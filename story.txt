1. We want to approximate non-PSD matrices in sublinear time
2. One option is to CUR, which works fairly well and has theoretical guarantees
3. If though our matrix is PSD or close PSD then Nystrom is much better (support with plots for e.g. twitter)
4. However Nystrom often totally bombs on non-PSD matrices
5. So we introduce regularized nystrom which does better
6. you can set min_eig in many ways and just discuss them
